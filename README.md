# pyredfruit

A Pomodoro timer written in Python and Python GTK.

## Install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/antgel/pyredfruit
pipenv install  # --dev if you're going to hack on the code
pipenv run pyredfruit
```

## Alternatives 

I found [Pomodorino](https://github.com/cadadr/pomodorino) after
"starting" this project. It's far more mature than this, but has
somewhat ground to a halt ([Doesn't run on Python
3.10](https://github.com/cadadr/pomodorino/issues/63), [packaging
issues](https://github.com/cadadr/pomodorino/issues/49) etc.). If that
project picks up steam, I'll abandon this; it looks great but I couldn't
get it to run and I don't need anything complex at the moment.
